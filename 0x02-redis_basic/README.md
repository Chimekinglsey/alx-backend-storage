Another lightening fast database is here...Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)!
It's both an in-memory cache (RAM) and supports almost every data type. It's a full blown database of it's own and has modules that support all kinds of data store--structured, unstructed, etc with an almost unbeatable read and write speed (upto 110,000 set per second)

In this project, we will look at redis and it's python support (redis-py)
